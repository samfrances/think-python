5.14 Exercises (p.47)
====================

**Exercise 5.1.** The `time` module provides a function, also named `time`, 
that returns the current Greenwich Mean Time in “the epoch”, which is an 
arbitrary time used as a reference point. On UNIX systems, the epoch is 1 
January 1970.

```
>>> import time
>>> time.time()
1437746094.5735958
```

Write a script that reads the current time and converts it to a time of day in 
hours, minutes, and seconds, plus the number of days since the epoch.
